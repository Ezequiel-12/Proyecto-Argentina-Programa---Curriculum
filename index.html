It was very smallâ€”around 5000 people filled the place I called home. I would say I spent the happiest times of my childhood there. From the ages of four to fourteen, my years were spent enjoying the two to three feet of snow we'd get each year, hiking the beautiful Glacier National Park on weekends, and admiring the deer and bears that would visit my backyard from time to time.</p>
